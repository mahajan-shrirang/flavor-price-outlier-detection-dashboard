            **What it does:** Uses artificial intelligence to find similar suppliers or products with different prices, helping you identify cost-saving opportunities.
            
            **How to use it:**
            
            **Page 1: Setup and Training**
            1. **Select features** that the AI should consider (e.g., Country, Product Type, Application)
            2. **Choose matching features** for finding similar items
            3. **Click "Train AI"** and wait for processing to complete
            4. **Click "Next"** to see recommendations
            
            **Page 2: View Recommendations**
            1. **Set your preferences**:
               - Minimum similarity (how similar items should be)
               - Minimum cost difference (how much savings to show)
            2. **Apply filters** to focus on specific categories
            3. **Select a recommendation** from the table to see details
            4. **Review the comparison** between similar items
            
            **What you'll learn:**
            - Alternative suppliers with similar products but lower prices
            - Potential cost savings opportunities
            - Why certain suppliers are more expensive than others
            - Data-driven negotiation points
            
            **When to use this:**
            - Looking for alternative suppliers
            - Preparing for price negotiations
            - Benchmarking current suppliers
            - Cost optimization projects
